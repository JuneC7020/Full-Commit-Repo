# Python List Comprehensions: From Beginner to Pro

List comprehensions are one of Python's most elegant and powerful features. They allow you to create lists in a concise, readable way that often outperforms traditional loops. Let's dive deep into this Pythonic magic!

## What Are List Comprehensions?

A list comprehension is a compact way to create lists. Instead of writing a multi-line loop, you can express the same logic in a single, readable line.

### Basic Syntax
```python
# Traditional approach
numbers = []
for i in range(10):
    numbers.append(i * 2)

# List comprehension approach
numbers = [i * 2 for i in range(10)]

print(numbers)  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
```

## Beginner Level: Basic Comprehensions

### Simple Transformations
```python
# Square numbers from 1 to 10
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11)]
print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

# Convert strings to uppercase
words = ['hello', 'world', 'python']
upper_words = [word.upper() for word in words]
print(upper_words)  # ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'PYTHON']

# Extract lengths of strings
word_lengths = [len(word) for word in words]
print(word_lengths)  # [5, 5, 6]
```

### Working with Strings
```python
# Split sentences into words
sentences = ["Hello world", "Python is awesome", "Code with passion"]
all_words = [word for sentence in sentences for word in sentence.split()]
print(all_words)  # ['Hello', 'world', 'Python', 'is', 'awesome', 'Code', 'with', 'passion']

# Extract vowels from text
text = "Python Programming"
vowels = [char for char in text.lower() if char in 'aeiou']
print(vowels)  # ['y', 'o', 'o', 'a', 'i']
```

## Intermediate Level: Adding Conditions

### Filtering with `if`
```python
# Get even numbers only
numbers = range(20)
evens = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(evens)  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

# Filter words longer than 3 characters
words = ['cat', 'elephant', 'dog', 'butterfly', 'ant']
long_words = [word for word in words if len(word) > 3]
print(long_words)  # ['elephant', 'butterfly']

# Get positive numbers from a list
mixed_numbers = [-5, 10, -3, 0, 7, -1, 15]
positives = [x for x in mixed_numbers if x > 0]
print(positives)  # [10, 7, 15]
```

### Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator)
```python
# Convert negative numbers to 0, keep positives
numbers = [-2, 5, -1, 0, 3, -4]
processed = [x if x >= 0 else 0 for x in numbers]
print(processed)  # [0, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0]

# Mark numbers as 'even' or 'odd'
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
labels = ['even' if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd' for x in numbers]
print(labels)  # ['odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even']
```

## Advanced Level: Nested Comprehensions

### Flattening Lists
```python
# Flatten a 2D list
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened = [item for row in matrix for item in row]
print(flattened)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Flatten with condition
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
evens_only = [item for row in matrix for item in row if item % 2 == 0]
print(evens_only)  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

### Working with Dictionaries
```python
# Create dictionary from two lists
keys = ['name', 'age', 'city']
values = ['Alice', 25, 'New York']
person = {k: v for k, v in zip(keys, values)}
print(person)  # {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}

# Filter dictionary items
scores = {'Alice': 85, 'Bob': 92, 'Charlie': 78, 'Diana': 96}
high_scores = {name: score for name, score in scores.items() if score >= 90}
print(high_scores)  # {'Bob': 92, 'Diana': 96}
```

## Pro Level: Complex Examples

### Data Processing Pipeline
```python
# Process a list of student data
students = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'grades': [85, 90, 78]},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'grades': [92, 88, 95]},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'grades': [78, 82, 80]},
    {'name': 'Diana', 'grades': [96, 94, 98]}
]

# Get students with average grade >= 85
top_students = [
    student['name'] 
    for student in students 
    if sum(student['grades']) / len(student['grades']) >= 85
]
print(top_students)  # ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Diana']

# Create grade summary
grade_summary = {
    student['name']: {
        'average': sum(student['grades']) / len(student['grades'),
        'max': max(student['grades']),
        'min': min(student['grades'])
    }
    for student in students
}
print(grade_summary)
```

### File Processing
```python
# Read lines and process them (simulated)
lines = ["  hello world  ", "  python  ", "  programming  "]
processed_lines = [
    line.strip().title() 
    for line in lines 
    if line.strip()  # Skip empty lines
]
print(processed_lines)  # ['Hello World', 'Python', 'Programming']
```

## Performance Tips

### When to Use List Comprehensions
```python
# ✅ Good: Simple transformations
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1000)]

# ✅ Good: Filtering with simple conditions
evens = [x for x in range(1000) if x % 2 == 0]

# ❌ Avoid: Complex logic that reduces readability
# Better to use a traditional loop for complex operations
```

### Memory Considerations
```python
# For large datasets, consider generator expressions
# List comprehension (stores all in memory)
large_list = [x**2 for x in range(1000000)]

# Generator expression (memory efficient)
large_generator = (x**2 for x in range(1000000))
```

## Common Patterns

### Creating Ranges with Conditions
```python
# Multiples of 3 and 5
multiples = [x for x in range(1, 100) if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0]

# Prime numbers (simple check)
primes = [x for x in range(2, 50) if all(x % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1))]
print(primes)  # [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
```

### String Manipulation
```python
# Extract numbers from mixed strings
mixed = ["abc123", "def456", "ghi789"]
numbers = [''.join(char for char in s if char.isdigit()) for s in mixed]
print(numbers)  # ['123', '456', '789']

# Create acronyms
phrases = ["Python Programming Language", "Machine Learning Algorithm"]
acronyms = [''.join(word[0].upper() for word in phrase.split()) for phrase in phrases]
print(acronyms)  # ['PPL', 'MLA']
```

## Pro Tips

> **💡 Pro Tip 1:** List comprehensions are often faster than traditional loops because they're optimized at the C level in Python.

> **💡 Pro Tip 2:** Use `enumerate()` in comprehensions when you need both index and value:
> ```python
> indexed_items = [(i, item) for i, item in enumerate(['a', 'b', 'c'])]
> ```

> **💡 Pro Tip 3:** For complex logic, consider breaking comprehensions into multiple steps for better readability.

## When NOT to Use List Comprehensions

```python
# ❌ Too complex - use a traditional loop instead
result = []
for item in complex_data:
    if complex_condition_1(item):
        processed = complex_function_1(item)
        if complex_condition_2(processed):
            result.append(complex_function_2(processed))
```

## Conclusion

List comprehensions are a powerful Python feature that can make your code more readable and often faster. Start with simple transformations, gradually add conditions, and explore nested comprehensions as you become more comfortable.

Remember: **Readability counts!** If a list comprehension becomes too complex, a traditional loop might be better.

### Key Takeaways:
- ✅ Use for simple transformations and filtering
- ✅ Great for data processing pipelines  
- ✅ Often faster than traditional loops
- ❌ Don't sacrifice readability for conciseness
- ❌ Avoid overly complex nested comprehensions

Happy coding! 🐍✨
